## Motivations
In recent years, the number of scientific publications has been growing in a dramatic rate. Given the huge volume of scholarly papers, a long-standing research challenge is how to effectively evaluate the impact of scientific literature. A typical way to measure the impact of a scholarly paper is through the number of citations received after publication, reflecting the influence in the research community. Peer review is a widely adopted paper evaluation mechanism, in which three or more reviewers would be assigned to decide whether to accept or reject a paper. During the review process, the reviewers should assess the paper quality in terms of several important factors, including originality, correctness, substance and readability. Intuitively, peer review data should be useful to predict future impact of a paper, since the review text contains assessment comments from domain experts. To address the need for predicting citation count based on peer reviews, we present this dataset.
